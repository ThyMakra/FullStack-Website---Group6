          <li>Submerge the chopped eggplant in cold water and leave for 15 minutes. This will remove some of the bitterness.</li>
          <li>In a large pot over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon oil, grated ginger and apple. Stir and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add onion and cook for 3 minutes, or until the slices have softened and are translucent.</li>
          <li>Add water and stir. Add carrot, potatoes, and green beans and stir. Bring to a boil and lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>Drain the eggplant and pat dry with a paper towel. In a large pan over medium high heat, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and when the oil is hot, add the eggplant. Cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, until golden and tender. Turn the heat off and transfer to a plate covered with paper towel. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Break the curry roux and stir it into the pot until it&apos;s completely melted.</li>
          <li>When there&apos;s 10 minutes left to the cooking process, open the lid and add the eggplant and cherry tomatoes. Put the lid back on and simmer for the remaining 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Serve with fukujinzuke (Japanese relish) and cooked Japanese rice.</li>
