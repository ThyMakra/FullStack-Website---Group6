[] Can not delete the recipe, because of the M2M relations

[] update schema

[] create pages for the new tables

## Development

### Set Up Environment Variable 

Copy the following 2 environment variable files and name the new files as described below:

1. Copy `.env.sample` and name the new file as `.env`
2. Copy `dev.env.sample` and name the new file as `dev.env`

### Run with Docker Compose

1. Running The Services

    ```bash
    yarn dkc:dev:up
    ```
    
    > If you update the services docker images, you need to run `yarn dkc:dev:build` instead.

### Run locally

1. Installing The Dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

2. Generate The Prisma Client and Migrate 

    ```bash
    yarn prisma:generate 
    yarn prisma:migrate 
    ```


2. Build and Run The NEXT Application

    ```bash
    yarn build
    yarn start
    ```

### Additional Commands

These are the additional commands related to the services inside the docker container:

- Accessing Database Docker Container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it postgres psql ingredeck postgres

    # /dt
    ```

- Count Table Rows: 

    1. Display All Tables and The Total Number Of Rows In Each Table

        ```sql
        SELECT schemaname,relname,n_live_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;
        ```

        A more accurate approach: 
        ```sql
        WITH tbl AS
            (SELECT table_schema,
                    TABLE_NAME
            FROM information_schema.tables
            WHERE TABLE_NAME not like 'pg_%'
                AND table_schema in ('public'))
            SELECT table_schema,
                TABLE_NAME,
                (xpath('/row/c/text()', query_to_xml(format('select count(*) as c from %I.%I', table_schema, TABLE_NAME), FALSE, TRUE, '')))[1]::text::int AS rows_n
            FROM tbl
            ORDER BY rows_n DESC;
        ```

- Exporting The Database Contents To An SQL Dump File

    ```bash
    docker exec -it postgres pg_dump -U postgres ingredeck > exported_file.pgsql
    ```

- Importing The Database Dump file Into The `postgres` container

    1. Copy the dump file to the container volume:

        ```bash
        docker cp exported_file.pgsql postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        ```

    2. Run the container and import the dump file

        ```bash
        docker exec -it postgres psql ingredeck /bin/bash

        root@postgres:/# psql -U postgres ingredeck < /var/lib/postgresql/data/exported_file.pgsql
        ```

- Importing The Database Dump file Into The Hosting Database

    ```bash
        psql -d {database_uri} < exported_file.pgsql
    ```

- Migrating The Database:

    In case the database container is not up-to-date with the migrations, we can use this command to manually migrate the database with the specified migration versions in `prisma/migrations/`

    ```bash
    docker exec -it next-prisma-docker_app_1 yarn prisma:migrate
    ```

- Reset The Database Migration:

    :warning: **Note** : This command will reset all data and previous migration in the database

    - Delete all migrations file: 

        ```bash
        sudo rm -r prisma/migrations/
        ```

    ```bash
    docker exec -it next-prisma-docker_app_1 prisma migrate reset
    ```

- Initialize The Prisma Schema

    ```bash
    npx prisma init
    ```
